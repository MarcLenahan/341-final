## Initial Ideas:
My idea for my website is going to be a portfolio site for all my work. I think this is a good time as any to start up a portfolio for all the work I will be creating for both classes and future careers. For me this could have been something I should have started a while ago but when I first joined this program I was a little self-conscience of my work. I know that is a common perspective for most people but it just took me a little bit longer to come to a point where I am enjoying the work I am creating despite it still being some sort of beginner level works. A lot of what I will try to add will polished class work but also my own photography and even personal projects to just keep in tune with the various programs we use in the Media Arts program. I will also try to use this website as a reference to possible oppurtunities of work and just get my toes in the water with this industry.
